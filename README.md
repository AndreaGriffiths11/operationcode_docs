# Operation Code Board Welcome

Welcome to the Operation Code board of directors, the governing board that supports mission execution at the 35,000 foot view of the organization. The responsibility and task is noble, honorable and challenging: ensure transitioning military, guard & reserve, veterans and their families don't get left behind in the 21st century new skills economy.

### Brief overview
Veteran-founded, and led, Operation Code is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit organization on a mission to get active military, citizen-soldiers, veterans and their families coding and building software to change the world. The organization is governed by an 9-member board.

### Purpose
Operation Code's purpose is to help our nation's finest and their families learn to code, network and transition to careers in the 21st century new skills economy while filling the nation's technical talent shortage. We don't believe veterans and their families who've served their country should be unemployed/underemployed.

### History
In 2012, ex-Army Captain David Molina applied to a coding bootcamp to learn how to build web applications using modern web technologies, and again in 2014 and couldn't use his New GI Bill. In 2014, Dave launched Operation Code as an open source project and soon began the Software Mentor Protégé Program connecting volunteer software engineers with transitioning military, guard & reserve soldiers, veterans and their families learn to code, all using a simple spreadsheet and a phone. This quickly expanded to an online Peer-to-Peer software mentorship program, and strategic partnerships with industry IT leaders to offer conference scholarships to the Operation Code military/veterans community. The organization was formed as an Oregon nonprofit on June 11, 2015 and received it's tax-exemption on May 4, 2016. Full history available [here](https://operationcode.org/history).

### Core Values
- Agile. We are expeditious in everything we do and innovative in all our approaches. We will bring new technology and new ideas to provide the best results for veterans.

- Service. We exist to meet the needs of veterans. We will humbly remember that their service was of the highest order and that Operation Code works for them.

- Accountability. We hold ourselves responsible for obtaining results that fulfill our Mission Statement and work towards our Vision. Donors, volunteers, and veterans can trust that Operation Code will do its best with the resources it is given.

- Integrity. We act consistently with Operation Code's mission, being honest and transparent in what we do and say, and accept responsibility for our collective and individual actions.

### Board Duties
Specific board duties, include, but not limited to:
- Ensuring the best interest of military veterans is a priority in each decision;
- Creating, developing and approving fundraising programs;
- Approving budgeting and spending plans;
- Electing new directors and officers;
- Expanding financial and job placement support; and
- Improving community support for affiliated military veterans.

As a director, you'll participate in periodic board meetings, attend the annual board meeting, serve on any number of committees, including, executive, nominating, finance and development committees, all designed to support our operational efforts.

As a director, you're expected to get monies and resources and/or give of your monies and resources to Operation Code to ensure the organization is firing on all cylinders at all times. When donating online, donors give using Stripe, receive an automatic donor letter, and our OpCodeBot relays the successful donation in the #general Slack channel with, "Someone awesome has just donated to Operation Code!"

### Legal
As the general counsel to Operation Code, Hunton & Williams, provides pro-bono legal advice to our veterans to help them in their journey to develop technology companies, incorporate their companies, non-competes and intellectual property. Secondly, Hunton provides legal counsel to the organization's board and leadership to ensure regulatory compliance, contract development. Legal, otherwise known as the JAG Brigade, provides legal support to Operation Code and our military veterans community at no-cost.

### Communication
We use the private Slack #board channel for all internal board communication. While we post taskers on Trello and email for external communication, Slack is the main communication tool. It also keeps all directors grounded on the issues our military veterans community learning to code faces.

On Slack, we use the #general channel to communicate general announcements, #patriotbootcamp for alumni to mentor potential veteran entrepreneur applicants, and the #operations channel for volunteer staff to coordinate, integrate and synchronize day-to-day efforts. All other channels support our veterans to get coding, from #ruby to #freecodecamp.

During your board tenure, ensure the board chair always has your updated contact information. Additionally, an @operationcode email account is also available for your use to conduct business on behalf of the organization.

### Programs & Services
At Operation Code, we fulfill our mission through five major programs & services:
- Software Mentor Protégé Program (SMPP). Operation Code has provided 1-on-1 mentorship as well as peer-to-peer mentorship leveraging Slack, a communication app, helping transitioning military and veterans get questions about code schools, get unstuck in their coding education, and share resources and tips building open source software with some of the most popular programming languages, including Ruby, JavaScript, iOS, and Android. More [here](https://operationcode.org/mentorship).

- Scholarships. Operation Code has enabled 8 military veterans travel to/from software engineering conferences, including Ruby on Ales and Signal, to learn more about programming languages, network with their peers, and connect with future employers in the technology industry. As a partner of GitHub, 4 veterans will attend the 2016 CodeConf LA in Los Angeles, an open source conference, and Ruby on Ales partner our veterans learn more about ruby. The education & mentorship activities reduce veterans unemployment, reduce veterans suicide rate, and reduce veterans homeless rate by providing military veterans technical knowledge that is in high rate by providing military veterans technical knowledge that is high-in-demand, boost self-esteem and provide military veterans financial resources to improve their employment outcome. More [here](https://operationcode.org/scholarships).

- Employer Services. Through Operation Code’s Employer Services, military veterans get support on their resume, preparation for technical interviews and get connected with technology companies interested in hiring veterans that can code. This is leading to future partnerships to hire veterans, figure out a good business model, and help close veterans unemployment. More [here](https://operationcode.org/employers).

- Deploy. At Operation Code, we take web developer apprenticeship to a whole new level by connecting with entrepreneurs on their projects and providing a real-world application experience for our veterans to work on and gain real-world experience using a range of front-end and back-end technologies all built to modern web standards. Deploy employs military veterans to code and shorten the junior developer 2-year time gap. More [here](https://operationcode.org/deploy).

- Advocacy. In late 2014, a Marine Veteran was being taken advantage by a code school and a financial institution and without Operation Code's involvement would have lost his deposit. We took immediate action and the code school and financial institution reversed its decision and the Marine veteran was able to attend. Today, this Marine Veteran is a junior .NET software developer. It also means we lead efforts to ensure more code schools accept the New GI Bill through technical support and long-term policy efforts.
