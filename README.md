# Operation Code Board Welcome

Welcome to the Operation Code board of directors, the governing board that supports mission execution at the 35,000 foot view of the organization. The responsibility and task is noble, honorable and challenging: ensure our nation's finest acquire the technical skills to succeed in a 21st century knowledge economy.

### Brief overview
Veteran-founded, and led, Operation Code is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit organization on a mission to get active military, citizen-soldiers, veterans and their families coding and building software to change the world. The organization is governed by an all-volunteer board.

### Purpose
Our purpose is to fill the nation's technical talent shortage with our nation's finest. At Operation Code, we don't believe veterans and their families who've sacrificed so much for their country should be unemployed/underemployed, all while millions of tech jobs are vacant at American technology companies. It's simply a nonstarter and unacceptable.

### History
In 2012, ex-Army Captain David Molina applied to a coding bootcamp to learn how to build web applications using modern web technologies, and again in 2014 when he learned that between 1/4 and 1/3 of monthly code school applicants were New GI Bill related. In summer 2014, Dave launched Operation Code as an open source project and began the Software Mentor Protégé Program connecting volunteer software engineers with transitioning military, guard & reserve soldiers, veterans and their families learn to code, all using a simple spreadsheet and his iPhone. This quickly expanded to an online peer-to-peer software mentorship program using Slack. Operation Code began its conference scholarship program to send veterans to software conferences and formed as an Oregon nonprofit on June 11, 2015. On May 4, 2016, the Internal Revenue Service issued Operation Code 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status. [Learn more about our history here](https://operationcode.org/history).

### Communication
In the spirit of open source and transparency, seamless communication and team coordination we use a variety of tools to help us ship faster and deliver on our vision. During your board tenure, the following communication tools will ensure your situational awareness.

First, we use [Slack](https://slack.com), the real-time messaging app to coordinate, integrate and synchronize efforts for mission execution. Operation Code maneuvers its efforts in a remote, decentralized operating environment and leverages Slack for all organizational and internal communication. As a board director, you will be automatically subscribed to the `general`, `board`, `operations`, `development`, and `social media` channels. In the spirit of transparency and open source, Slack serves as our go-to communication platform, our virtual office and where veterans are learning to code, get help with jobs and network with each other in a supportive, and nurturing learning environment.

Secondly, we use [GitHub](https://github.com), the open source platform to track, monitor and update all operationcode.org actions, and the `operationcode-dot-org` Slack channel for quick communication. If you have an idea that touches our website directly, please create an [issue](https://github.com/operationcode/operationcode/issues) and read the [CONTRIBUTING guide](https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Finally, we use Salesforce, the world's customer relationship management platform for back-office tracking. Any contact we make with a donor, company, etc goes into Salesforce for team follow-up.

### Programs & Services
At Operation Code, we fulfill our mission through five major programs & services at no-cost to veterans:
- Software Mentor Protégé Program (SMPP). Operation Code has provided 1-on-1 mentorship as well as peer-to-peer mentorship leveraging Slack helping transitioning military and veterans get questions about code schools, get unstuck in their coding education, and share resources and tips building open source software with some of the most popular programming languages, including Ruby, JavaScript, iOS, and Android. [Learn more](https://operationcode.org/mentorship).

- Conference Scholarships. Operation Code has enabled 16 military veterans travel to/from software engineering conferences, including GitHub Universe, CodeConf LA, Ruby on Ales and Signal, to learn more about programming languages, network with their peers, and connect with future employers in the technology industry. The education & mentorship activities reduce veterans unemployment, reduce veterans suicide rate, and reduce veterans homeless rate by providing military veterans technical knowledge that is high in-demand, boost self-esteem and provide military veterans financial resources to improve their employment outcome. [Learn more](https://operationcode.org/scholarships).

- Military Veterans Technical Talent Pipeline. Through Operation Code’s Military Veterans Technical Talent Pipeline program, military veterans get support on their resume, preparation for technical interviews and get connected with technology companies interested in hiring veterans that can code. Ensuring our veterans fill the nation's technical talent shortage is why we exist. [Learn more](https://operationcode.org/employers).

- Deploy. At Operation Code, we employ military veterans to write code for client websites and web applications. By hiring our own, we ensure our veterans can support themselves, continue their learning while driving any profits (after Labor & Material) back to the nonprofit to keep delivering our programs & services. [Learn more](https://operationcode.org/deploy).

- Code School Technical Assistance. Only a half-dozen code schools across the United States offer the New GI Bill to pay for veterans tuition, room and board. Our team provides technical assistance to non-VA approved code schools. Additionally, we partner with code schools to provide financial assistance, from partial to full scholarships to Operation Code veterans. [Learn more](https://operationcode.org/code_schools).

### Legal
As the general counsel to Operation Code, Hunton & Williams, provides pro-bono legal advice to our veterans to help them in their journey to develop technology companies, incorporate their companies, non-competes and intellectual property. Secondly, Hunton provides legal counsel to the organization's board and leadership to ensure regulatory compliance, and review legal contracts. Internally, we call our general counsel the JAG Brigade.
