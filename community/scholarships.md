## Procedure for Requesting a Scholarship

### Where can I find scholarships?

Scholarships will be posted as they are received to the Slack announcer in #general and #coding-schools. Users will then be asked to fill out a form if they would like to apply for the scholarship.

### How are scholarship recipients selected?

Recipients will be chosen on a merit basis, by the mentors involved in the Operation Code Mentorship Program. 

Criteria for conference scholarships are the following: 
* Willing to provide 2-3 sentences about why you would like to attend the conference and what you hope to get out of it; 
* A transitioning military, guard & reserve troop, veteran and/ or military family; 
* Interested in coding and software development as a post-military career pursuit and/or make your big idea a reality; 
* Actively engaged in our community on Slack; 
* Active contributor in our open source projects on GitHub; 
* Follower and participant in our social media profiles, ex. Twitter & Facebook; 
* Willing to be interviewed pre-conference for our Medium to share your story; 
* Willing to document your experience and lessons learned in Medium on the conference within two weeks.

Unfortunately, at this time we are unable to cover travel/lodging. However, our development team is actively pursuing opportunities to fund this.
