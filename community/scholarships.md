## Procedure for Requesting a Scholarship

### Where can I find scholarships?

Scholarships will be posted as they are received to General and Scholarships channels. Users will then be asked to fill out a form if they would like to apply for the scholarship.

### How are scholarship recipients selected?

Recipients will be chosen on a merit basis, by the mentors involved in the Operation Code Mentorship Program. 

Criteria for conference scholarships are the following: 
* Be willing to provide 2-3 sentences about why you would like to attend the conference and what you hope to get out of it; 
* Be a transitioning military, guard & reserve troop, veteran and/ or military family; 
* Be interested in coding and software development as a post-military career pursuit and/or make your big idea a reality; 
* Be actively engaged in our software mentorship community on Slack; 
* Be an active contributor in our open source projects on GitHub; 
* Be a follower and participant in our social media profiles, ex. Twitter & Facebook; 
* Be willing to be interviewed pre-conference for our Medium to share your story; 
* Be able to document your experience and lessons learned in Medium on the conference within two weeks.

Unfortunately, at this time we are unable to cover travel/lodging. However, our operations team is actively pursuing fundraising opportunities to ensure end-to-end conference travels are seamless in the future.
