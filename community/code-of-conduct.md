# Operation Code: Code of Conduct

Operation Code is committed to building a safe, welcoming, harassment-free culture for everyone. We do not merely want a community that is free from hostility; we want one that is actively welcoming and inclusive.

We strive to create a welcoming and inclusive culture that empowers people to provide outstanding public service. That kind of atmosphere requires an open exchange of ideas balanced by thoughtful guidelines. If we have only openness, colleagues who are on the receiving end of thoughtless or intentionally hurtful comments and behavior may reasonably withdraw. If we have overly intrusive guidelines, people may feel unwelcome.

## Our standards

It would be impossible to list everything we can do to create a more welcoming space, and we know this team will find ways to include their colleagues that we haven't even thought of. But when in doubt, we encourage you to look to these principles for guidance:

* Practice empathy and humility.
* Assume that everyone we work with is doing their best work for the community.
* Listen carefully and actively. Encourage other people to listen as much as they speak.
* Ask questions, and seek to understand your partners' context.
* Treat other people's identities and cultures with respect. Make an effort to say people's names correctly and refer to them by their chosen pronouns.
* Use welcoming and inclusive language.
* Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
* Gracefully accept constructive criticism.
* Focus on what is best for the community.

## Unacceptable behavior

To help colleagues understand the kinds of behaviors that run counter to the culture we seek to foster, we've listed below actions that are counter to our values.  We've also included steps to take if you encounter behavior that runs contrary to this policy.

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
* Public or private harassment.
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission.
* Sustained disruption of meetings, talks, or discussions.
* Mocking someone's real or perceived accent or first language.
* Repeatedly interrupting or talking over other people in meetings and discussions.
* Negative or offensive remarks based on gender expression, mental illness, socioeconomic status or background, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, or body size.
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting.

## Our responsibilities

[Our staff][https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode_docs/blob/master/community/points_of_contact.md] is responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. For discussions on this, please join the #community-feedback channel on Slack, or email us at <community@operationcode.org>.

[Our staff][https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode_docs/blob/master/community/points_of_contact.md] has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within online spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of Operation Code may be
further defined and clarified by [staff][https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode_docs/blob/master/community/points_of_contact.md].

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the team at <community@operationcode.org>. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Volunteers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the [staff][https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode_docs/blob/master/community/points_of_contact.md].
