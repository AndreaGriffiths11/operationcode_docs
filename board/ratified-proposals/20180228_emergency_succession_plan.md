## Purpose
Operation Code’s Board of Directors adopts the following emergency executive succession plan, to be executed in the event the CEO temporarily or permanently vacates the CEO position.

## Policy
The Board authorizes the Executive Committee to implement this policy in the event of an unplanned departure or temporary absence of the CEO. 
“Temporary absence” is defined as a leave of absence of more than 14 days (medical or other), as opposed to short term vacation.

In the event of such a vacancy, the COO shall serve as interim CEO.  
Authority. The interim CEO shall have the full ordinary authority of a permanent CEO, except for:
- Financial decisions of more than $10,000
- Termination of staff
- Final decisions on reputational issues (government policy and advocacy, etc.)
- Compensation. In the event of a departure or a temporary absence lasting longer than 30 days, the interim CEO shall receive a temporary salary equivalent to the bottom of the pay range for the permanent CEO, or a 10% increase above their current salary, whichever is greater.
- Oversight. Given the extraordinary circumstances, the Executive Committee shall monitor and support the interim CEO through regular meetings (to be defined as appropriate) with a designated board member and an appropriate communication channel.

In the event of a permanent vacancy, the Executive Committee shall also implement the following: 
- Review. In consultation with the Governance Committee, the Executive Committee shall review the CEO job description and the organization’s current challenges, and assess required key competencies required for a new CEO. 
- The Board Chair shall appoint an executive search task force consisting of board members and staff, as appropriate. The interim CEO shall not be on the task force if they are a candidate for the permanent position.
- In the event of a successful search and upon hiring, the Executive Committee will work with the new CEO to design and implement a three-month transition plan, with the goal of ensuring a successful transition.

As soon as reasonably possible, the Executive Committee shall prepare a draft communication regarding the transition, which shall be issued by the Board Chair and communicated to to Operation Code staff and volunteers, members, and key funders:
- Key internal information to include departure date of current CEO, information on temporary leadership and any related impact on the chain of command. 
- External communication should communicate the Board’s decision on interim leadership, information on the permanent selection process (if required) and key contact information.
