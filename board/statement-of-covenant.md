Operation Code
Board Director Statement of Covenant 

Certification Form
 
 
As a board member of Operation Code, I, _______________________, understand that my duties and responsibilities include the following:
 
I am responsible for the health and well-being of this organization. As a member of the board, I have pledged myself to help realize the mission, which is: 
 
The Operation Code mission is to help the military community learn software development, enter the tech industry, and code the future! Through teaching veterans, transitioning service members, and their families to code with open source projects, we’ll be able to help fill our economy’s technical talent shortage with our nation’s finest.
 
I am fiscally responsible, with the other board members, for this organization. It is my duty to know what our budget is, to be active in planning that budget, and planning the fundraising to meet that budget.


I am legally responsible, along with other board members, for this organization. 
I am responsible to know and approve all policies and programs, and to oversee the implementation of policies and programs. 
I understand that Operation Code is governed by its Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, that additional guidance on my responsibilities as a Board member are provided in the State of Oregon’s Guide to Nonprofit Service, and that I am responsible for reviewing and understanding these documents. 
I will attend all board meetings unless circumstances beyond my control prevent my attendance, and I will be available for home consultation. 
I will read materials sent to me in advance of the board meetings. 
I understand that if I am absent without excuse from regularly scheduled board meetings more than one time in a year that I will be asked to resign from the board. 
I know that if I neglect my duties or if I act in bad faith, it may be possible for me to be held personally liable in suits brought by a private person, a business, a governmental entity, or even the organization itself. However, I understand that I am not responsible for the day-to-day operations of the organization as these are the responsibility of the chief executive.
My one direct management responsibility, along with other members of the board, is the selection and supervision of the chief executive.
 
In keeping with the Board Director Contribution Policy, I will give what is for me a significant donation. I may give this as a one-time donation each year, or I may pledge to give a certain amount several times during the year.
 
Also in keeping with the Board Director Contribution Policy, I will work to raise money for Operation Code, in whatever ways are best suited for me. These may include individual solicitation, helping with special events, introducing Operation Code executives to potential foundation and corporate supporters, working on fee-based income opportunities, and more. While there is a small minimum requirement (as part of the Board’s combined “give/get” approach), there is no outer limit on the amount of money I can raise to bolster Operation Code’s growth and ensure its success. And I understand that Operation Code’s executive team is committed to supporting my efforts.


I will act with the care and loyalty required of board members, and put the interests of the organization first. In so doing, my work with Operation Code will embody the values expressed in the Code of Conduct. 
 
In keeping with Operation Code’s Confidentiality Policy, I will observe the organization’s commitment to protecting both the privacy of its members and donors, and the organization’s trade secrets and intellectual property.
 
In keeping with Operation Code’s Conflict of Interest Policy, I will observe the organization’s commitment to transparency and proper management of conflicts of interest in letter and spirit. I will accordingly take care to disclose publicly any conflicts that arise in the course of my business or the organization’s, and to recuse myself from decisions that create or appear to create a conflict of interest for me.


I promise to preserve the investment of time and money made over years by all the donors and volunteers who created this organization and brought it to this point. Every board member is making a statement of faith to carry out the above agreements to the best of our ability, each in our own way, with knowledge, approval, and support of all.
 
In its turn, Operation Code is responsible to me in a number of ways:
 
I will be sent, without request, regular financial reports that allow me to review Operation Code’s financial position.


I can call on the staff to discuss program and policy, goals, and objectives.


Board members and staff will respond in a straightforward and thorough fashion to any questions I have that I feel are necessary to carry out my fiscal, legal, or moral responsibilities to this organization.


D&O insurance will be provided.
