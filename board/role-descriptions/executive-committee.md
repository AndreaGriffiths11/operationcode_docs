Executive Committee
Role and Responsibilities
PURPOSE 
The purpose of the Executive Committee (the Committee) of Operation Code’s Board of Trustees is to serve as a:
“Think tank” for the CEO and the Board;
Mechanism for making some decisions in between quarterly board meetings; and
Means of enhancing the current and future viability and quality of the Board.
COMPOSITION 
Membership will consist of Board members who have demonstrated longstanding commitment and a deep understanding of Operation Code’s work and mission; a group of “wise heads” who can offer guidance to the CEO and the board as a whole.  
The Chair will be a Board member and will not serve as Chair for more than two (2) years.  The Board may remove or replace the Chair at any time.  
The Board Chair is a member, and is typically the chair.  The Vice Chair, Secretary and Treasurer are typically members, as well.  Additional members can instead be recruited from the Board at large.

The Committee may establish subcommittees as deemed appropriate, e.g., a group working on governance, nominating, strategic planning, etc.
The CEO shall serve as ex officio member of the Committee.
