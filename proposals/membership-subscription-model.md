EXAMPLE 1
All AWIS (Association of Women in Science) members need to join the national level and then the local chapter level. (https://www.awis.org/join/)
Example AWIS membership for MA (http://www.massawis.org/) requires the following:
Option 1: To join MASS AWIS at the Chapter level for $40, please click here.Note: Students who wish to serve on the MASS AWIS Board must join at the Junior membership level through National AWIS.
Students joining at the Chapter level will receive only chapter benefits and will not receive electronic communications and benefits from National AWIS (i.e. access to AWIS Magazine, STEMinars, Washington Wire, and other programs). However, student members at the chapter level are encouraged to connect with the national organization in the following ways:

Subscribe to the free monthly newsletter AWIS in Action!
Follow AWIS on Twitter
Like AWIS on Facebook
Network in the AWIS LinkedIn group
Option 2: To join AWIS at the National level along with the Chapter, please click here.
While students are not required to join at the National level, students may elect to join AWIS at the ‘Junior’ level by completing the registration process here and paying both National and Chapter dues (total $90).

Student membership at the Junior level includes these additional benefits:

EXAMPLE 2
Stacy: I think you can follow this model which is a bit more applicable to operation code Healthcare Businesswomen's Association (HBA) https://www.hbanet.org/chapters/boston

Note this is a FOR PROFIT organization 

https://www.hbanet.org/sites/default/files/Documents/HBA_Central/AnnualReport/HBA_2014_annual_report.pdf


*Their Scholarship program:The HBA is pleased to offer a new associate membership rate for those 30 and under. This membership rate is designed to attract emerging professionals and give them an introduction to the HBA. 


IEEE membership structure…
Adsfasdfasdf 


David Reis: 

What I like about the membership pricing:
The reasonable rates.
I think they are reasonable, but we might want to do a focus group or two to understand how best to roll this out. Otherwise...could kick us in you know what. 
Concept of differentiating between types of members is a great idea
note: would need to differentiate between types of benefits for members. E.g., if you have a lot of professionals or want them (we do), then they need to have benefits that work for them.  If you can't explain the benefit, response will be depressed.
Notion of scholarships for folks.  Good and necessary, but needs definition, standards, and to be credibly fair. So, an independent panel without bias reviews applications, and there is a budget with limited funds AND a process (first come/first served? An application process with a deadline?) etc. 

Suggest: check ACM and IEEE membership stuff for reasons of style, language, cultural similarities sans the veteran piece. They are big and complicated, so not suggesting going crazy. Still, lots of engineer talk!  Side note: ACM has LOCAL CHAPTERS. Might be good to find out how well they work or don't work.  

Finally, with respect to Leadership Circle.
Totally fine with renaming.
That said, this IS a leadership opportunity. That's a piece of what we want. Volunteers willing to lead. We don't really want to engage people who aren't willing to lead by helping to identify and bring in new supporters!!!  Now...there CAN be quiet folks who contribute this way...people who have money, don’t volunteer, maybe don’t have time. But we do want activist volunteers!
Most annual giving societies, for that is what this is, do not have a price point below $1,000. I adapted pricing for what we thought Operation Code members would be willing to bear.
I suggest dropping the $100 and $250 levels, and keeping $500, $1,000, $2,500 and $5,000.  I.e., in view of the proposed membership pricing.
We would solicit and engage "Leadership Circle" participation in a couple of ways
Direct response via email campaign, directed at those identified as professionals.
Volunteer committee made up of those willing to commit to a $1,500 give/get annually, who are willing to 1) help organize very cool inexpensive cultivation events in their communities designed to attract tech and STEM professionals...people who like tech AND care about vets and military and 2) bring in new people. Usually these kinds of committees require people to bring in 2-3 new donors a year. Committee membership is open-ended (e.g., get 2-3 volunteers going in key cities...you could have 50 people on one national committee but working locally)
This committee would partner with the Board Fundraising Committee and the CCDO.  The CCDO would ultimately have an annual fund person staff this, though probably not right now given the immediate need for corporate $.  
Committee members would be effectively "level two" of fundraising volunteers, with board being "level one". Future board members…
