# Chapter
The following content is a guideline for chapter management.

## Chapter Leaders
It is assumed that new chapter members have little or no experience with software development. Groups must be able to facilitate integrating new members. For this reason, each chapter will have a designated *Chapter Leader* who can work with individuals to explain programming concepts to team members if necessary. An Operation Code Chapter Leader organizes meetups and events at the local level.

### Responsibilities
* Enforce the Code of Conduct.
* Host events, including trainings, talks, hack nights, etc.
* Build partnerships in the local community.
* Raise funds and in-kind donations in support of the mission.
* Build and integrate the infrastructure necessary to sustain the chapter.
* Reach out to potential new members, receiving and integrating them to the team.
* Advocate for and promote the organization in the local community.

### Attendance
Chapter leaders are expected to be present for all meetups in which their chapter is active. If they cannot attend a meeting, they should notify a *Community Manager* on Slack prior to the event so arrangements can be made.

### Availability
If a chapter project extends past the first meeting, we encourage the chapter leader to maintain contact with his team. chapter leaders can make themselves available to answer questions outside of the meetup via slack. This maintains a level of consistency with members of the chapter.  It is also recommended that a team DM is created by the chapter leader to share any pertinent information with their team.

Introduction resources will also be available to new members to consume when away from the meeting.
